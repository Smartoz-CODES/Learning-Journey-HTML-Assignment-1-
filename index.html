    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
    <article>
    <p> I'm Taiwo, a 300-level Distance Learning student in the Computer Science Department at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, currently based in Lagos, Nigeria.

        I was born and brought up in the ancient city of Ibadan, where I spent the amazing early and most significant part of my life. Growing up, I loved reading stories, and I even wrote a couple myself. During my early Junior Secondary School days, I often found myself on the school hall podium every Thursday, participating in debates. I discovered that I had a natural ability to present my views on topics I understood in a compelling and astonishing manner and my team always won.
        
        However, my secondary school days were quiet and not particularly interesting. We had to move to the some other area of Ibadan, and I lost access to the old friends I had grown fond of. 
        
        After earning my National Diploma in Computer Science from the Federal School of Statistics, Shasha, Ibadan, I moved to Lagos on my own in search of greener pastures. Those were tough times before I was finally able to settle down. I worked in a medical laboratory before transitioning into a Customer Care Representative role, and eventually, I secured a remote job with a planning company in the UK.
        
        Over the past few years, I've been in survival mode until I decided it was time to find purpose. This decision led me back to my childhood dream of creating my own mobile game. I was inspired by the magic I witnessed on sefan.ru, which collaborated with Java to provide beautifully designed mobile games. That experience led me to enroll in the Front-End Engineering program at AltSchool Africa, to begin the journey of rediscovering myself.
        
        I'm passionate about making a real difference and impact in my generation. I've recently enrolled to start learning Software Engineering, specializing in the Front-End niche.

        <h2> WHY I JOINED ALTSCHOOL </h2>
        <p> Being a 300-level Computer Science student, it was time for our SIWES (Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme), and I joined AltSchool so I could gain first-hand, in-depth experience in the real life application of all the theoretical knowledge Iâ€™ve acquired over the past few years in school. I wanted to finally put it to use in real world scenarios.

            I realized that AltSchool has everything it takes to accelerate my journey into the tech world, with its structured, hands-on learning approach. Another major reason I joined was because Hack Sultan put out a scholarship opportunity, where the top 10 participants would go home with a laptop and I happened to be a beneficiary of both the scholarship and the laptop.
            
            Knowing fully well how much of a legend Hack Sultan is in the Nigerian tech Twitter space, I didn't hesitate for a second to be a part of the AltSchool program. </p>

    <h2> MY GOALS FOR SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING </h2>
        <p>My primary goal is to become a confident and professional Front-End developer by the end of the program. I aim to:
        <ul>
          <li>Master core web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue Js and Typescript</li>
          <li>Build and deploy real-world web, mobile and pc applications that solves problem in specific industries</li>
          <li>Build my own Journalling and Procastination Beater Web application that help users get tasks done effectively with laid down structures </li>
          <li>Collaborate on group projects and contribute to open-source</li>
          <li>Prepare for internships and full-time roles in tech</li>
        </ul>
